\title{\textbf{Subsurface Features of Lunar Pits} \\ A Contemporary Survey}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Lunar pits, revealed through high-resolution orbital imagery, are compelling geological features that provide access to the Moon's subsurface. These structures offer critical insights into ancient volcanic activity, expose the stratigraphy of the lunar crust, and present opportunities for future exploration. This survey consolidates current understanding of their morphology, formation mechanisms, thermal properties, and spatial distribution. By leveraging data from key missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and SELENE, this work highlights the significant discoveries made regarding these features. Lunar pits are emerging as pivotal elements in lunar science, with the potential to reshape exploration strategies and resource utilization in the years ahead.
